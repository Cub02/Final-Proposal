I want to create a ASCII art generator to create other forms of art. For example I have used a ASCII art generator to produce the second photo. I would like to use it as a tool to help me create more designs for other projects. I have seen ASCII art being used in visualizations, and social media, but I have never seen it being used as a texture before. Texture in the sense that when you make the words small enough they take the form of textures in an image. It gives an aesthetic that I have yet to see in designs. I will use the ASCII art P5.js library and follow the guide of https://www.tetoki.eu/asciiart/index.html from the refernce in the P5.js library examples.
